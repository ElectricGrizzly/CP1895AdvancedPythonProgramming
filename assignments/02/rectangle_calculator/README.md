## Specifications
1. Use a Rectangle class that provides attributes to store the height and width of a rectangle. This class should also provide methods that calculate the perimeter and area of the rectangle. In addition, it should provide a method that gets a string representation of the rectangle.
2. When the program starts, it should prompt the user for height and width. Then, it should create a Rectangle object from the height and width and use the methods of that object to get the perimeter, area, and string representation of the object.
